# hello-world
I'm a beginner programmer hoping to become a web developer by next year. I'm halfway through a Udemy ZTM course for Python and will be moving on to learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and react from Angela Yu's web developer course. You can find my exercises and projects in my profile. Enjoy!
